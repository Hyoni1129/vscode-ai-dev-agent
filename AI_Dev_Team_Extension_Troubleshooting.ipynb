    "\n",
    "First, let's verify that your extension's `package.json` correctly registers the chat participant according to VS Code's guidelines.\n",

    "### ✅ Current Configuration Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on your `package.json`, here's what we found:\n",

    "\n",
    "The activation events determine when your extension is loaded. This is crucial for chat participants to be available when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❗ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Your original `package.json` had:\n",

    "\n",
    "- `onChatParticipant:ai-dev-team` - Activates when chat participant is needed\n",
    "- Removed `onStartupFinished` to prevent unnecessary early activation\n",
    "- This ensures your extension loads exactly when the chat participant is accessed\n",
