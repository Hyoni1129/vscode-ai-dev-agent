### File Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/           # AI agent implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/            # Core workflow management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/           # TypeScript type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/           # Utility functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ extension.ts     # Main extension entry point
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (`WorkflowManager`)
- **Functions/Methods**: camelCase (`executeWorkflow`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_RETRIES`)
- **Files**: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for utilities

### Comment Guidelines

```typescript
/**
 * Brief description of the function
 * 
 * @param context - Workflow context containing state and configuration
 * @param action - Specific action for the agent to perform
 * @returns Promise resolving to the agent's execution result
 */
async execute(context: WorkflowContext, action: string): Promise<AgentResult> {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Compile the project
npm run compile

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run tests (when available)
npm run test
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-end tests**: Test complete workflows

Example test structure:
```typescript
describe('WorkflowManager', () => {
    it('should initialize all agents correctly', () => {
        // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('should handle workflow state transitions', async () => {
        // Test implementation
    });
});
```
